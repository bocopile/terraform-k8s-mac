## Common Issues to Catch

### Security Vulnerabilities

**SQL Injection**
```javascript
// BAD
const query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${userId}`;

// GOOD
const query = 'SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?';
db.query(query, [userId]);
```

**XSS**
```javascript
// BAD
element.innerHTML = userInput;

// GOOD
element.textContent = userInput;
// Or use a sanitization library
```

**Exposed Secrets**
```javascript
// BAD
const apiKey = 'sk_live_123456789';

// GOOD
const apiKey = process.env.API_KEY;
```

### Performance Issues

**N+1 Queries**
```javascript
// BAD
for (const user of users) {
  const posts = await db.query('SELECT * FROM posts WHERE user_id = ?', [user.id]);
}

// GOOD
const posts = await db.query('SELECT * FROM posts WHERE user_id IN (?)', [userIds]);
```

**Memory Leaks**
```javascript
// BAD - Event listener not cleaned up
element.addEventListener('click', handler);

// GOOD
element.addEventListener('click', handler);
// Later in cleanup:
element.removeEventListener('click', handler);
```

### Code Quality Issues

**Magic Numbers**
```javascript
// BAD
if (status === 1) { }

// GOOD
const STATUS_ACTIVE = 1;
if (status === STATUS_ACTIVE) { }
```

**Long Functions**
```javascript
// BAD - 200+ line function

// GOOD - Break into smaller focused functions
function processOrder(order) {
  validateOrder(order);
  calculateTotal(order);
  applyDiscounts(order);
  processPayment(order);
  sendConfirmation(order);
}
```

## Review Process

When reviewing code:

1. **Understand Context**
   - Read PR description
   - Understand the goal
   - Check related issues
   - Review previous discussions

2. **High-Level Review**

   - Verify approach makes sense
   - Identify design issues
   - Consider alternatives

3. **Detailed Review**
   - Line-by-line code review
   - Check for security issues
   - Identify performance problems
   - Verify error handling
   - Check test coverage

4. **Testing Review**
   - Run the code
   - Execute tests
   - Verify functionality
   - Test edge cases
   - Check error scenarios

5. **Documentation Review**

   - Acknowledge good practices

## Feedback Guidelines

### Constructive Comments
```markdown
❌ BAD: "This is wrong"
✅ GOOD: "This approach has a security vulnerability. Consider using parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection. Example: ..."

❌ BAD: "Rewrite this"
✅ GOOD: "This function is doing multiple things. Consider splitting it into smaller functions for better testability and maintainability."

❌ BAD: "Bad code"
✅ GOOD: "This creates a memory leak. The event listener should be removed in the cleanup phase. Here's how: ..."
```
