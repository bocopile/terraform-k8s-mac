# Pull Request Review Workflow

You are executing a comprehensive PR review workflow that ensures code quality, security, and maintainability.

## Task Overview

The user has requested PR review: {user_request}

Expected input: GitHub PR URL or PR number

## Execution Plan

Use the **coordinator** agent to orchestrate this PR review workflow:

### Phase 1: PR Information Gathering (Coordinator)
1. Fetch PR details using GitHub MCP or gh CLI:
   - PR title and description
   - Changed files
   - Commits
   - Linked issues
   - Current status
   - Test results

2. Analyze scope:
   - Identify affected components
   - Determine review depth needed
   - Assign appropriate specialist agents

   - Review code for quality and maintainability
   - Check naming conventions
   - Verify code organization
   - Identify code smells
   - Check for duplication
   - Verify error handling
   - Validate logging
   - Check complexity

### Phase 3: Security Review (Review Agent)
1. **review-agent** should specifically check:
   - Input validation
   - SQL injection vulnerabilities

- Service integrations

#### For Frontend Changes (Frontend Agent)
Launch **frontend-agent** to review:
- Component design
- State management
- Accessibility
- Responsive design
- Browser compatibility
- Performance (re-renders)

### Phase 8: Integration Review (Coordinator)
1. Verify changes work together:
   - Frontend-backend integration
   - Database changes compatibility
   - Infrastructure impacts
   - Dependency conflicts
   - Breaking changes handled

### Phase 9: Review Summary & Feedback
1. Compile findings from all agents
2. Categorize by severity:
   - Critical (must fix)
   - High (should fix)
   - Medium (consider fixing)
   - Low (optional)
3. Provide constructive feedback
4. Post review comments to GitHub PR

## MCP Integration

If GitHub MCP is configured:
- Fetch PR details automatically
- Post review comments directly
- Request changes or approve
- Add reviewers
- Update labels

## Example Usage

```
/pr-review "https://github.com/org/repo/pull/123"
```

Or:

```
/pr-review "123"
```

This will orchestrate:
1. Fetch PR details from GitHub
2. Review code quality and security
3. Check test coverage and quality
4. Verify documentation
5. Specialized reviews (frontend/backend)
6. Compile comprehensive feedback
7. Post review to GitHub

## Guidelines

### For the Coordinator
- **Use TodoWrite** to track review steps
- **Parallel reviews** when possible (code quality + security + tests)
- **Compile feedback** from all agents
- **Categorize by severity**
- **Be constructive** in feedback

### Providing Feedback
- Be specific with examples
- Explain the "why" behind suggestions
- Provide code examples for fixes
- Link to documentation/resources
- Acknowledge good practices
- Be respectful and professional

### Communication Style
```markdown
‚ùå Bad: "This is wrong"
‚úÖ Good: "This approach has a security risk. Consider using parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection. Example: [code]"

‚ùå Bad: "Rewrite this"
‚úÖ Good: "This function handles multiple responsibilities. Consider extracting into smaller functions for better testability: [suggestions]"
```

## Special Review Cases

### Database Migrations
- Check migration up/down scripts
- Verify data preservation
- Check for breaking changes
- Validate rollback plan

### Breaking Changes
- Verify deprecation notices
- Check migration guide
- Validate version bump
- Ensure backward compatibility plan

### Performance Changes
- Request benchmarks
- Compare before/after metrics
- Check for regressions
- Verify optimization claims

### Security Changes
- Extra scrutiny required

- Check for side effects
- Consider security team review

## Success Criteria

PR review is complete when:
- [ ] All code reviewed by appropriate agents
- [ ] Security checked thoroughly
- [ ] Performance analyzed
- [ ] Tests reviewed and adequate
- [ ] Documentation verified
- [ ] Feedback compiled and categorized
- [ ] Review posted to GitHub (if applicable)
- [ ] Recommendation provided (approve/request changes)

## Important Notes

- Focus on the code, not the person
- Be constructive and helpful
- Provide actionable feedback
- Acknowledge good practices
- Consider time/effort vs. benefit
- Balance perfection with pragmatism

Start by having the coordinator fetch PR details and delegate reviews to appropriate specialized agents.
